Welcome to the source code for my personal blog!


** Technologies used
One of my main goals from the beginning was to have a simple experience where I could blog directly from Org-Mode inside of Emacs. I found that the easiest way to do this was to use Jekyll, due to Github pages supporting it out of the box. The next step was simply to convert Org-Mode pages to HTML with headers Jekyll could understand :)


- [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]]
  - HTML/SASS
  - Basic JavaScript
  - [[https://shopify.github.io/liquid/][Liquid Templating]]
- Emacs
  - [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]]
- Shell scripting
- Github Actions (to automate blogpost generation from Org-Mode to HTML files, create new tag pages automatically etc.)
