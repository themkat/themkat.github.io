About a week ago, I uploaded the first video to my new YouTube channel. Yesterday, the second video followed! So far they have both been about Emacs, but other videos will be about other things as well. My main goal with the channel is "to share the love for computing; Past, present and future!" :) 


Feel free [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_3sv9P5H8wShL1cRnsHDjA][to subscribe]] and watch my videos if you enjoy my content :) It helps me out, and makes the content reach more people (thanks to the "almighty algorithms") :) So far there is a video about [[https://youtu.be/J4s3T0dd5CY][Kotlin in Emacs]], and one about [[https://youtu.be/9O_0vwrLCow][recommended Emacs packages]].
